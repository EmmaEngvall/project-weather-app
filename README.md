# Weather App

This week's project was to build a simple weather dashboard that tells today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## The problem

This assignment was completed in pairs. We chose to do the HTML and JS together and then create our separate branches to handle the styling. 
We followed the "Design 2" brief for our styling.
